### PROBLEM STATEMENT
To develop an accurate, automated medical image classification system
using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve disease
diagnosis and support clinical decision- making.
### Objectives
1. Diagnostic Accuracy: To Build robust CNNs to accurately detect and classify diseases
across multiple medical fields.
2. Automated Segmentation: To Use CNNs for precise organ, tumor, and lesion
segmentation.
3. Interpretability: To Enhance CNN transparency with visualizations and explanations
for clinician trust.
4. Data Scarcity & Bias: To Use data augmentation and synthetic data to improve
diversity and generalization.
5. Ethics & Privacy: To Apply privacy-preserving methods and follow ethical AI
guidelines.
6. Clinical Adoption: To Create user-friendly tools for seamless integration into
workflows
### Results
This project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for
medical image classification and automated disease diagnosis. The comprehensive methodology employed
including careful data collection, robust preprocessing, advanced model architecture, and systematic training
showcases the power and potential of deep learning in the field of medical informatics. Through the
utilization of publicly available medical imaging datasets and thoughtful augmentation, the model achieved a
high level of accuracy, precision, and generalizability across multiple disease categories and imaging
modalities.
